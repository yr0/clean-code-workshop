# Document Verification

The code in this sample represents a process of a very simplistic document verification. 
The "document" is a JSON that contains some fields and their values.

Upon verification, the process is expected to "send" an email to the user urging them to fix the error with 
their document. In a very special case when the document owner is a known fraudster, we want to register a notice at
the fraud department.
